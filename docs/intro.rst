Philosophy
----------

This API is being developed with the following philosophy in mind.

#. Allow **fast** access to the entire database.
#. Make sensible default choices for the user (e.g., avoid high signal to noise ratio records).
#. Allow easy overriding of default choices.
#. To provide methods that are consistent across programming languages (e.g., Matlab, Python, R)
#. Follow the ideals of :pep:`20` as closely as possible.
